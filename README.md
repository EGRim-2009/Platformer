## Reflections
unexpected events invoving the absence of participants

Your write up will go here

We made 7 big changes:

	Elijah:
		Crouch - Made it so if you hold down crouch (s or down arrow) you are able to jump higher
		Score - Added a score counter in the HUD, increases each time you collect one coin
		End Goal - Added a fruit at the end

	Hugo:
		Two Players: Created two players, one player is controlled by wasd and the other by arrow keys
		Multi-Tracking Camera - Created a camera that tracks multiple targets
		Lives - Added a lives counter in the HUD. Everytime a player is attacked by an enemy, the lives go down by 1
		Damage Animation - Created an animation that activates each time a player is attacked by enemy
		
	Logan:
		Was absent for most of the project and wasn't able to get any features done
